# Daily-Planner-Calendar

## Description

In this project I have to create a calendar application. This application allows user to save events for each hour of the day, to creat this application I have to following the instructions:

* Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner;

* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down;

* Color each timeblock based on the past, present and future when the timeblock is view;

* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock;

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock;

* Persist events between refreshes of a page.
